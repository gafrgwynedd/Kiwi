A Poem About Kiwis and the Dragon and the Lion

Farming kiwis, cutting vines
Chop chop chop
Lappers clacking

Farming kiwis, pulling strings
Dance dance dance
Unwinding vines

Farming kiwis, growing fruit
Gold, green, red
Kiwis everywhere above my head

Cutting females, saving males
Chop chop chop
The males' flowers make big sales

And the dragon came and ate all the kiwis
The lion rawred!

Is it possible to merge two branches that are not the master?
